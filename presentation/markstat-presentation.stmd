# Introduction

 + What is a dynamic document?

 In the context of this presentation, what we call a *dynamic document* is a
 document that contain both text and Stata outputs, where the outputs are updated
 automatically every time the script is run.


# Introduction

 + Why use dynamic documents?

 Most tools for dynamic documents are created with *literate data analysis* in mind,
 where code and documentation is being produced together to increase research transparency.

# Introduction

When to use dynamic documents?

 + Include text and outputs in the same document -- no more having to copy and
 paste figures, tables or plots to a document editor!
 + Nice option for simple documents that don't require a lot of formatting
 + Can include code snippets or code examples in a document too
 + Quickly visualize formatted tables

# Introduction

Pros:

 + Save time spent on copying and pasting or switching software
 + Best option to include (and run) code in a document

Cons:

 + Error messages may not be super clear (specially when using LaTeX)
 + Harder to include detailed formatting
 + No syntax highlighting for the text part in many editors
 (like the dofile editor), which makes it harder to debug text formatting

# Introduction

 + There are a handful of options for dynamic documents in Stata
 + You can find a review of different options [in this link](https://www.stata.com/meeting/oceania16/slides/rising-oceania16.pdf)
 + For this presentation, we will use [`markstat`](https://data.princeton.edu/stata/markdown/gettingStarted), as I believe it's the most general and user friendly
 + At the end of this presentation, you can find some material on the different tools for dynamic documents in Stata

# Introduction

**`markstat`**

 + Stata command created by German Rodriguez
 + Allows users to create and compile Stata markdown files by combining Stata code and markdown text
 + Saves the outputs to PDF, word, HTML and beamer


# Introduction

**`markstat`**

   1. Reads the Stata markdown file
   1. Separates (*tangles*) markdown and Stata code
   1. Runs each of them separately
   1. Puts their outputs back together (*weaves*) into a single document in the format you choose


# Introduction

[**`markdown`**](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

 + Lightweight markup language
 + Designed to be easily readable
 + We won't go into details about markdown in this session, but some resources are listed in the end of this presentation
 + This session's material includes a cheatsheet with everything you need to know to complete today's exercises

# Get the material

1. Go to [the session OSF page](https://osf.io/8sgrh/)
1. On the Files section, select `OSF Storage > 2021_02 - RA Continuing Education (Stata Markdown)`
1. Download the file `stata-markdown-CE-session.zip`
1. Unzip the file in a location you can remember

# Installation

Install the necessary programs

 1. [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)
	+ If you use a WB computer, please use the Windows `.zip` installation file instead of the `.msi` installer and take note of the location where you unzip the Pandoc folder
 1. [TeX/LaTeX](https://miktex.org/download)

# Installation

 Find out where the programs are installed

 + `pdflatex`:
 	+ On Windows: open the command line and type `where pdflatex`
 	+ On Mac or Linux: open the terminal and type `which pdflatex`
 + `pandoc`:
 	+ On Windows:
		+ WB computers: use the path where you unzipped Pandoc
		+ Non-WB computers: open the command line and type `where pandoc`
	+ On Mac or Linux: on the terminal, type `which pandoc`

# Stata setup

1. Go to the location where you unzipped the file `stata-markdown-CE-session.zip`
1. Open `Master.do`

# Stata setup

![master](img/master.png){width="75%"}\


# Stata setup

1. Paste the location of pdflatex to the line that starts with `whereis pdflatex`
	+ Example: *"C:/Program Files/MiKTeX 2.9/miktex/bin/x64/pdflatex.exe"*
	+ **On Windows:** Make sure to include the `.exe` file extension
1. Paste the location of Pandoc to the line that starts with `whereis pandoc`
	+ Example: *"C:/WBG/pandoc-2.11.4/pandoc.exe"*
1. Make sure all the locals in `PART 0` are equal to 1
1. Run `Master.do`


# `markstat`  {.fragile}

The command that creates the final document is `markstat`

~~~
markstat using filename,
    [pdf docx slides beamer mathjax
	 bibliography strict nodo nor keep]
~~~

# `markstat`  {.fragile}

In our case, we used:

~~~
markstat using stata-markdown-template, pdf
~~~

`stata-markdown-template` is the file with the extension `.stmd` you will find in the materials folder.

It contains the Markdown and Stata code we just rendered to a `pdf` file using `markstat`.

Try opening it in the do-file editor to see how its content relates to the file generated.

# `markstat`

### Exercise 1:

Test different output formats for `Stata markdown template` by specifying on master:

1. `markstat using "${{mdfolder}}/Stata markdown template", pdf`

1. `markstat using "${{mdfolder}}/Stata markdown template", docx`

1. `markstat using "${{mdfolder}}/Stata markdown template", slides`

1. `markstat using "${{mdfolder}}/Stata markdown template", beamer`


# `markstat`

Here are some notes on Exercise 1:

* Go to [`markstat` website](https://data.princeton.edu/stata/markdown/presentations) to see how to change the slides theme

* On beamer, slides with Stata code or output need to be in the fragile style. It can be set like this:

~~~
		# Slide title {.fragile}
~~~

* You might have noticed that the materials folder contains a file named `stata.sty`. This file is necessary
to render Stata Markdown code using `markstat`, and it should be placed in the same folder as your `.stmd` file

# `markstat`

In some systems, you will not be able to replace the PDF if it's open. There are two possible solutions:

 + Close the PDF file before running `markstat`; or

 + Close the PDF file once you get an error message and press enter on the command window


# `markstat`

+ Writing markdown in Stata with `markstat` is simple, and similar to what would be done in `R`, for example
+ Check the file called `Stata markdown template.stmd` on your Do-file editor to see how it works
+ To write text, write markdown without indentation
+ Check `Resources/markdown-cheatsheet.stmd` for examples of how to format text using markdown

# Including Stata code

+ The simplest way to write Stata code is start a line with four spaces or one tab:

~~~
 This is regular text
 Hello world!

	*This is Stata:
	sysuse auto, clear
~~~

# Including Stata code

+ You can also use fenced code blocks (as the one below)
+ They make the `.stmd` file harder to read, but allow you to use more advanced
options -- we'll see some examples soon

~~~
 Write text without indentation

```{s}
	* Write stata code inside chunks
	sum mpg
```
~~~

# Including Stata output

### Exercise 2:

1. Under the second title in `Stata markdown template.stmd`, add Stata code
using a command that prints some output to the Stata window
(`summarize`, `keep`, `gen` and `tab` are good examples)
1. Save the markdown file
1. If you have a PDF open, close it
1. Open `Master.do`
1. Set the `packages` and `paths` locals to `0`
1. Run `Master.do`

# Including Stata output {.fragile}

~~~
```{s}
	* Summary of miles per gallon
	sysuse auto,clear
	sum mpg
```
~~~

```{s}
	* Summary of miles per gallon
	sysuse auto, clear
	sum mpg
```


# Including Stata graphs {.fragile}

To include Stata graphs:

1. Create the graphs in Stata
2. Save it locally using `graph export`
3. Use the following markdown syntax to include the graph: `![figure caption](figure name.png)`

# Including Stata graphs {.fragile}

~~~
```{s}
    scatter weight length, ///
		legend(off)
    graph export scatter.png, width(800) replace
```

![Correlation between weight and length](scatter.png)
~~~

# Including Stata graphs

### Exercise 3

1. Go to `Stata markdown template.stmd`
1. Create and export a graph using the loaded data (you can use the command `scatter`, for example)
1. Include markdown code to display the graph you just saved
1. Save the markdown file
1. If you have a PDF open, close it
1. Run `Master.do`

# Including Stata graphs {.fragile}

```{s}
    scatter weight length, ///
		legend(off)
    graph export scatter.png, width(800) replace
```

![Correlation between weight and length](scatter.png)

# Omitting Stata code {.fragile}

+ Depending on the type of document you are writing, you may want to only display the results of your code (tables, graphs, etc)
+ This is when using strict code blocks is useful
+ To omit the Stata code from the document, type `{s/}` on the opening of your code chunk


# Omitting Stata code {.fragile}

~~~
```{s/}
    scatter weight length, ///
		legend(off)
    graph export scatter.png, width(800) replace
```

![Correlation between weight and length](scatter.png)
~~~

# Omitting Stata code {.fragile}

```{s/}
    scatter weight length, ///
		legend(off)
    graph export scatter.png, width(800) replace
```

![Correlation between weight and length](scatter.png)


# Omitting Stata output

+ Now, the last slide probably wasn't exactly what you were expecting, right?
+ Using `{s/}` will omit the code you used, **but not the messages it generated**
+ To omit any message, simply run your code `quietly`


# Omitting Stata output {.fragile}

~~~
```{s/}
    scatter weight length, ///
		legend(off)
    quietly graph export scatter.png, width(800) replace
```

![Correlation between weight and length](scatter.png)
~~~

# Omitting Stata output {.fragile}

```{s/}
    scatter weight length, ///
		legend(off)
    quietly graph export scatter.png, width(800) replace
```

![Correlation between weight and length](scatter.png)

# Including Stata tables {.fragile}

+ To include estimation results, we recommend using `esttab`
+ The window output of `esttab` is well-formatted, and including that output
is the simplest way to display a table
+ `esttab` also exports to HTML and TeX, but those are more advanced examples that are beyond the scope of this presentation
+ You can find more detailed examples in the [Stata Markdown website](https://data.princeton.edu/stata/markdown/examples)

# Including Stata tables {.fragile}

~~~
```{s/}
	qui reg price headroom
	est sto reg1

	qui regress price headroom trunk
	est sto reg2

	qui regress price headroom trunk foreign
	est sto reg3

	esttab reg1 reg2 reg3, ///
		replace ///
		label se ///
		nomtitles
```
~~~

# Including Stata tables {.fragile}

```{s/}
	esttab reg1 reg2 reg3, ///
		replace ///
		label se ///
		nomtitles
```

# Including Stata tables {.fragile}

### Exercise 4

1. Go to `Stata markdown template.stmd`
1. Inside a Stata code block, run a few simple regressions on the loaded data
1. Use `esttab` to output the regression results
1. Save the markdown file
1. If you have a PDF open, close it
1. Run `Master.do`

# Including code inline

+ Sometimes we want to reference numbers in our text
+ If the numbers change for any reason, it's better to have them automatically updated than review the whole presentation for adjustments
+ Markdown lets you write code inline with your text

# Including code inline

+ Writing

~~~
Today is `s c(current_date)`.
~~~

+ Will result in

Today is `s c(current_date)`.

# Including code inline {.fragile}

### Exercise 5

Using inline Stata code, try to include the following items to your current markdown file:

+ The sample includes `s `models'` different car models 
+ `s `foreign'` are foreign models, and `s `domestic'` are domestic

# Including code inline {.fragile}

~~~
```{s}
qui count
local models `r(N)'

qui count if foreign == 1
local foreign `r(N)'

qui count if foreign == 0
local domestic `r(N)'
```
~~~

# Including code inline {.fragile}
~~~
+ The sample includes `s `models'` different car
models
+ `s `foreign'` are foreign models, and `s `domestic'`
are domestic
~~~

This results in:

+ The sample includes `s `models'` different car models 
+ `s `foreign'` are foreign models, and `s `domestic'` are domestic

# Including code inline {.fragile}

 + Inline code is particularly useful when you want to display a custom table
 + You can create the table using markdown, and add the numbers to the right columns using locals
 + However, to create these you need to specify the `strict` option when compiling
 + And they will not necessarily render will in all different formats

# Including code inline {.fragile}

 + Writing

~~~
| Car origin  | N obs        |
|:------------|-------------:|
| Domestic    |`s `domestic'`|
| Foreign     |`s `foreign'` |
~~~

 + Will result in

| Car origin  | N obs        |
|:------------|-------------:|
| Domestic    |`s `domestic'`|
| Foreign     |`s `foreign'` |

# Annex: Adding a title to your document

 + There are three pieces of metadata that you can easily add to your document: title, author and date
 + You can do this by adding the following code to the beginning of your document:

~~~
% Document Title
% Author
% Date
~~~
